# AI-ML-Internship
This repository contains my completed AI/ML internship tasks. It includes projects on data exploration, visualization, regression, classification, and other ML concepts. Each task is organized in a separate folder with Python scripts (.py), datasets (or dataset links), visual outputs, and a README summarizing objectives, steps, models, and results.
